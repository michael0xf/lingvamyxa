# L2 runtime plan (2026-09-14)

Owner: review chat (`lingvamyxa-e2`, Fable 5.1). Confirmed by Mikhail on
2026-09-14 (LEAD_REVIEW_20260914.md §6, decisions 15 and 16). This replaces
§6.4 of CORE_LEAD_INSTRUCTION_20260913_en.md as the runtime lane's plan.

## 1. What changed

The runtime lane so far ported the L1 runtime modules to L2 one by one, each
as a library unit with a parity runner against the unchanged L1 module. That
work proved the translator expresses the runtime (fifteen units, seven
translator gaps found and closed, RUNTIME_L2_PORTS.txt), and the runners are
the mechanism by which core code moves from L1 to L2.

Mikhail's ruling, in two parts. (a) The target is the core described in
L2_CORE_AND_MESSAGE_MODEL_20260912.md and the specification; intermediate L1
implementations are not permanent, and wherever the L1 prototype differs from
the model (the number/byte envelope, the exec host V0 table, the flag order
before decision 14) the model wins. (b) Since L2 is translated into L1 first,
the core may be finished in L1, where the form is freer, and then moved to
L2 by the port machinery; there is no confusion between the two: L1 is the
workbench and the bootstrap that spec 19.29.6 allows, L2 is where the core
lives when done. Acceptance of the core itself is the model's scenarios and
the spec's own checks; acceptance of each move to L2 is parity with the L1
module that was brought to the model first.

## 2. What the specification requires (the sources)

- 19.28.R2.2 Message Thread: management state is ordinary Structure data
  implemented in L2, not an external C control model. Each live Message
  owns its FIFO inbox/outbox, a parent capability (except the root) and the
  list of its direct children. The control flags (running, success) belong
  to the Message. No shared global Message registry, no global management
  lock, no language scheduler above Messages; each parent contains the
  scheduler for its direct children as private Structure data. Native
  thread, wait/wake and per-mailbox primitives support Message and do not
  own its policy or family tree.
- 19.29.6 Running Message (L3 Thread): one logical arena, FIFO queues, one
  serial execution lane, at most one turn at a time; different Messages may
  execute concurrently; concurrent senders are linearized at the recipient's
  FIFO admission; OS process startup is already the root Message. Its
  implementation/integration checks are the acceptance of this plan.
- 19.29.7 and 19.29.7.1 Message boundary: ordinary delivery adds LMX text to
  the receiver's one arena with ownership transfer, no deep copy, no identity
  rewrite. "Copy-only" is merge's copy and the Message's own arena, true for
  every Message (clarification added 2026-09-14). The number/byte envelope,
  the host ingress V0 and the exec host V0 are prototype history.
- Model L2_CORE_AND_MESSAGE_MODEL_20260912.md §29-§36: parent-owned
  scheduling, running/success and stop (§31, with decision 14: complete sets
  only success; running=0 follows success=1 only at the turn boundary, set
  by whoever executed the Message), family close (§32), liveness (§33),
  failure handoff (§34), the executed-argument-as-own bind and callable
  recursion.
- 9.1.4 eternal branches, 21 name resolution: unchanged and not part of this
  lane.

## 3. What is built, in stages

Mikhail (2026-09-14): the level at which a stage is first written is the
review chat's choice. Each stage is written in L1 where that is faster (the
workbench) and moved to L2 by a parity runner, or directly in L2 where that
is no slower; in L2 it is a unit with the `profile: runtime` directive
(decision 14: the executor's own core is never polled; checkpoint
diagnostics stay). Every stage is committed when it lands (decision 16). A
stage is accepted by the model's scenarios and the spec's own checks; the
L1 selftests are regression evidence for the bootstrap, not acceptance of
the core. The order below follows the gaps between the model and the L1
prototype, largest first.

1. **Message and L3 Thread as Structure data.** Mikhail (2026-09-14), the
   two kinds and their relation: a Message is simply an isolated LMX graph.
   An L3 Thread is a Message that can attach and/or execute any Message;
   every L3 Thread is a Message, not every Message is an L3 Thread (a
   template and a letter have no turn, a launched child does). The mailbox
   and the provision for a turn exist only at the L3 Thread, even when it is
   executed from outside and no OS thread of its own is started; therefore
   only the varieties of L3 Thread carry a scheduler. So, two families:
   - **Message**: its arena (blocks and ranges, one owner), the running and
     success flags (every Message has them, spec 19.29.7.1), and the
     capability of its owner/parent.
   - **L3 Thread**: a Message that additionally holds the FIFO inbox and
     staged outbox, the turn state, the list of its direct children and the
     scheduling of what it executes: its launched children and the Messages
     it attached after receiving them (the consumer schedules those itself,
     including executing one as part of itself), with the worker mapping and
     ready queues, all as its own isolated graph in its own arena. Mikhail
     (2026-09-14): that scheduler does not manage launched children as a
     whole. Its management is only the allocation of execution (selecting a
     child's turn) and removal on timeout, judged by the checks that come
     from the children themselves. The primary mechanism, as agreed with
     Astra: the child polls the parent, not the other way round, and closes
     itself when the parent has been absent too long. Closing a child from
     above is the second, emergency mechanism. In the normal mode children
     close themselves, and each child schedules its own children the same
     way (model §29, §33; spec 19.28.R2.2, 19.29.7.1). The executor's
     per-thread C state in exec.c (LmxMsgExec, bind table, map queues) and
     the per-Message mailbox/turn fields of LmxMsg are the prototype of this
     family. Creation by merge only (a copy, its own arena; 19.29.6 "creation
   through merge"). No integer address table: a delivery address is a
   capability the sender holds.
2. **Mailbox and delivery.** send stages a Message created by merge in the
   sender's outbox; publication at the sender's successful end-turn; admission
   transfers the arena into the recipient's inbox, FIFO, serialized against
   other admissions (the only place native synchronization lives); recv at
   turn entry materializes it into the handler's own arena by ownership
   transfer. Dedup key (recipient, sender, id), late replies rejected after
   stop, queue pressure as admission failure, as 19.29.7.1 lists them.
3. **Turns and the parent's scheduler.** One serial lane per Message; the
   parent selects a child's whole turn before another (19.28.R2.2 sequential
   mapping); a child may map its own children to workers. The escape
   (running=0 with success=0) unwinds only a requested stop. complete sets
   success; the turn boundary clears running from success. Physical workers
   are the parent's mapping, reached through `c.` (threads, events, waits
   stay C behind their existing functions).

   Design (2026-09-14, after stages 1-2 and the five core tests).
   *Today, the prototype (exec host V0, "evidence, not the accepted
   architecture", spec 19.29.7.1):* one `LmxMsgExec` per runtime holds a
   global lock, a global bind table (addr, turn function, ctx, affinity,
   held/held_by, launching, gone, a context record `LmxMsgBindWait` with the
   thread and its event), global owner-ready lists for ANY and UI (the
   parents whose children are ready), a retire list, and thread-local state
   (the turn Message, the turn root, the running-flag pointer). Contexts are
   one thread per bound non-UI Message; each loops take_ready (a child of a
   ready owner, through the global lists and the bind table) and run_one
   (turn root, body, boundary, native_leave, requeue). Per-Message state
   already exists on `LmxMsg`: the mailbox and its lock, turn/turn_ctx/
   mapped, parent and direct children, the parent-local readiness list of
   children (`sched_ready`, module lmx_msg_sched_ready, ported), the
   membership fields of the global lists (map_*), refs/native_users/
   handoff_ready, the liveness timers, running and success.
   *Target (19.28.R2.2, 19.29.6, model §25 and §29):* each running Message
   is an L3 Thread Message: its own mailbox and turn state, its own direct
   children, and its own scheduler state for those children as Structure
   data: readiness (exists), the mapping of children to physical workers
   (today the global bind table and contexts), the parent-local wake
   primitive (today the global ready event). No global bind table, no global
   owner-ready lists, no global management lock for policy; the runtime's
   internal synchronization stays where the model allows it (mailbox
   admission, lifecycle, transfer). Native threads, events, TLS and the
   setjmp turn root remain C and are called through `c.`.
   *Steps, each keeping run_lmx -Suite Message and the five core tests green
   and committed on its own:*
   - 3a. Bind state moves onto the child Message: affinity, held, held_by,
     last_st, launching, gone and the context record become fields of
     `LmxMsg` beside turn/turn_ctx/mapped; bind_index lookups become field
     reads; bind_grow goes; the table survives only as an enumeration index
     for start_contexts and drop_stale, then goes.
   - 3b. Owner-ready lists become per parent: a parent's ready children are
     its sched_ready list plus a per-parent "ready for a physical worker"
     signal; contexts belong to the parent that mapped the child (a
     parent-owned context list); the global map_own lists and the global
     ready event go; unbound children keep running on the parent's thread
     through sched_step.
   - 3c. The per-parent scheduler record (context list, mapping policy,
     ready heads) becomes an L2 Structure allocated in the parent's arena and
     driven by L2 code with own fields; exec.c's C structs become that
     Structure's cells. This is the port step (a `profile: runtime` unit),
     verified by parity against 3b.
   - 3d. UI affinity is a mapping policy of the parent that owns the UI
     worker (an L3 Thread whose lane is the UI thread), not a global class.
   Acceptance per step: run_lmx -Suite Message; the five core tests (the
   19.29.6 checks pin parallel execution and no overlap); the executor
   parity of lmx_message; a tripwire per step.

   Division (2026-09-14, agreed with the lead): the lead takes 3a-2 and 3b
   (exec.c and lmx_message.lm1's by-position uses, the Exec selftest's index
   API rewritten, contexts owned by the mapping parent); the review chat
   takes 3c (both halves) and each step's acceptance tests, and mirrors the
   lead's lmx_message.lm1 edits into lmx_message.lm2 so the parity runner
   stays green at every commit. 3a-1 (7d1d1a40 on fable/exec-3a) is the
   lead's to merge after the lane branch.

   3b contract (2026-09-14, agreed with the lead on integration 6d12b222,
   after 3a-2). Shape: (1) per parent: a scheduler record handle and, over
   it, enqueue/dequeue/remove/has of a direct child and the list of
   contexts the parent mapped; (2) executor side: a per-parent wake ("this
   parent has a child ready for a physical worker"), and the lane loop
   enumerates parents with a raised wake, never children; (3) nothing in
   lmx_message.lm1 enumerates bound records across parents. The
   enumeration that survives is each parent's own children: scan_ready
   asks the parent's record for its next ready child; drop_stale walks the
   parent's first_child/next_sibling and removes the stale ones from that
   parent's record. The two globals are thrown away: a walk of rt->slots
   (every Message of every tree) and an intrusive bound list (the bind
   table by another name). The one cross-parent walk left, the lane's
   enumeration of parents with a raised wake, lives in exec.c behind one
   function so 3c-2 replaces one call. Evidence (the lead's grep of the
   callers): scan_ready's only caller is take_addr from the lane loop, with
   no parent in hand, which is (2); drop_stale_ready has no production
   caller and goes; the Exec selftest cases that fabricated a ready,
   mapped child no parent lists (detach_child_keep_ready) are rewritten on
   real parents or deleted, with retire-exactly-once kept pinned, and a
   rewrite that cannot reach the property without the fabrication comes to
   the review chat before deletion.

   3b-7 and 3b-8 (2026-09-14, agreed with the lead during 3b). 3b-7, in
   four gated steps: (a) a per-parent context list (ctx_head/ctx_tail on
   the parent, ctx_next and a stored ctx_owner on the record), linked at
   bind onto ready_owner_of(child) and unlinked in unbind, behaviour-neutral,
   proven by a TEST-build agreement check against the table with red-first
   mutations on link and unlink; (b) start_contexts, stop, drop_binds,
   detach, wake and the lane catch-up walk parents from rt->root and their
   context lists, behind one exec.c function; (c) the by-address lookups
   read m->exec_bind through a find that does not skip RELEASED Messages,
   and the unreachable rebind branch goes; (d) the table, bind_grow/bind_cap
   and the by-position accessors go. The owner of a context is the owner of
   the ready entry: ready_owner_of(child), the child's parent or the child
   itself when parentless. ctx_owner is stored, like map_owner, for one
   reason only: lmx_msg_release_slot clears parent_msg (child_unlink) before
   it unbinds. That order is the defect by 19.28.R2.2 (a child's executor
   state belongs to its parent's scheduler record and must be torn down
   while the child is still that parent's child), and it also puts a bound
   parentless Message outside every family tree between its root-list
   unlink and its unbind, which a tree walk cannot see. So 3b-8 comes
   right after 3b-7a and BEFORE 3b-7b (order fixed 2026-09-14 with the
   lead): release_slot unbinds first, then child_unlink; lm1 and lm2 in one
   commit; map_owner, ui_map_owner and ctx_owner go, derived from
   ready_owner_of; the contract of child_unlink for a bound child is decided
   and stated there (lean: refused, a contract at the family boundary), and
   the TEST agreement check of 3b-7a turns strict while the table is still
   present as its oracle. Its reaching test is the failed-turn path releasing
   a bound uncommitted child. Then 3b-7b (the walks over the family tree,
   owner by owner, restart-to-fixpoint on start and teardown, no
   allocation), 3b-9 (found during 3b-7b: release_slot mutates the family
   tree with the exec lock dropped while every reader walks it under that
   lock; the lock is held around child_unlink and the root-list removal,
   lm1 and lm2 in one commit, red-first through a TEST hook between the
   unlock and child_unlink with a second thread walking the family), 3b-7c,
   3b-7d, then 3c-2's C half.

   3c design (drafted before 3b; the record of 3c-1 and the contract above
   fix it). The parent's
   scheduler record is an ordinary Structure allocated in the parent's
   arena by the parent's own Message code, reachable from the parent's graph
   (its root retains it), with these slots: the ready list of direct
   children (head, tail; today LmxMsg.sched_ready/sched_ready_tail),
   the list of contexts the parent mapped (today the per-bind
   LmxMsgBindWait records reached through the global table), the mapping
   policy (sequential on the parent's lane, one context per child, UI lane
   for a child with UI affinity), and the wake primitive handle of the
   parent's lane (today the global ready event). The L2 unit
   (`profile: runtime`) implements the operations over that Structure with
   the branch/value calls on the parent's arena: enqueue/dequeue a ready
   child, map/unmap a child to a context, select the next child turn
   (sequential mapping), request the children's close, and reports the
   19.28.R2.2 invariants the tests pin (a whole child turn before another;
   no shared list across parents). The C half keeps only what L2 cannot
   spell: thread start, event wait/signal, TLS of the current turn, the
   setjmp turn root, called through `c.`. Migration: the record is filled
   from the existing LmxMsg fields first (a view), then those fields move
   into it, then the executor reads only the record.
4. **Close, liveness, failure.** stop as KIND_STOP admission setting closing
   only; family close per §32; liveness queries and timers per §33 as
   self-maintenance of every running Message; failure handoff per §34 with
   the HISTORY roots (lmx_msg_history_owned's contract).
5. **Root Message and bootstrap.** OS startup is the root Message; the
   external process entry runs in its turn loop. The L1 runtime remains the
   bootstrap underneath until the L2 runtime hosts itself; then the L1
   modules are retired stage by stage.

## 4. Acceptance

- The 19.29.6 implementation/integration checks, as L2 tests: concurrent
  add requests to one owner produce the expected total; an execution trace
  follows the recorded admission order; own turns never overlap;
  independently mapped Messages execute in parallel. No fixed race winner is
  asserted, no success is fabricated from staging, no application lock or
  global manager is added to pass them.
- Model scenarios §31-§36: success/stop/failure, a parent with running=0
  still acting as lifecycle endpoint, orderly close of a family, liveness
  timeout closing a child, failure handoff of HISTORY roots.
- Every test has a tripwire that goes red (RUNTIME_L2_PORTS.txt discipline).
- The full self-build (`buildCore`, `run_lmx.ps1 -Suite Full`, the lead's
  gate list) passes on every merge; the whole project is committed each time
  it does (decision 16).

## 5. What the existing ports are for now

`lmx_message.lm2` and the fourteen module units stay in the tree as
translator evidence with their runners, and as the L1-shaped bootstrap while
stage 1-3 land. They are not extended. When a stage of the new runtime
replaces a bootstrap module, that module's runner is retired in the same
commit and the notes say why.

## 6. Coordination

- Lead (`lingvamyxa-d6`): translator gaps found by this lane, with fixtures
  as before; merges through integration; the model's §31/§34 wording carries
  decision 14; the full gate on every merge.
- Helper (`lingvamyxa-5e`): parser in L2 (§6.5) unchanged.
- Review chat: this lane, stage by stage; decisions carried to Mikhail;
  spec clarifications committed as docs the day they are made.
